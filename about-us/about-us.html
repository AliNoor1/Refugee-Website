				<h1>Who Are We</h1>
				<p>Refugee Alliance is a non-profit dedicated to welcoming migrants into the Front Range corridor and helping them find a community in Colorado. As a group of activists, students, and allies of the refugee community, we seek to help foster better connections between new arrivals and their respective settlement locations.
				By providing a space for refugees to share their stories, attend events, and access job training and education resources, we hope to help welcome them into their new home.</p>

				<h1>What We Do</h1>
				<p> Refugee Alliance aims to connect refugees in the Front Range with resources provided by various organization across the region.  
					This website pulls information from non-profits and groups from across the Front Range, and centralizes the material, making it easy for refugees to access numerous resources without having to search for them individually. 
					The website also provides a platform for refugees to share their stories, and upload artwork, poetry, music, and short narratives that will be seen by the entire community. 
					By fostering connections through this online site, we hope to help communities across Colorado better understand and connect with the refugees in their area.</p>
