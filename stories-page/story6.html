				<p>Syrian doves croon above my head<br>
their call cries in my eyes.<br>
I’m trying to design a country<br>
that will go with my poetry<br>
and not get in the way when I’m thinking,<br>
where soldiers don’t walk over my face.<br>
I’m trying to design a country<br>
which will be worthy of me if I’m ever a poet<br>
and make allowances if I burst into tears.<br>
I’m trying to design a City<br>
of Love, Peace, Concord and Virtue,<br>
free of mess, war, wreckage and misery.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Oh Syria, my love<br>
I hear your moaning<br>
in the cries of the doves.<br>
I hear your screaming cry.<br>
I left your land and merciful soil<br>
And your fragrance of jasmine<br>
My wing is broken like your wing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I am from Syria<br>
From a land where people pick up a discarded piece of bread<br>
So that it does not get trampled on<br>
From a place where a mother teaches her son not to step on an ant at the end of the day.<br>
From a place where a teenager hides his cigarette from his old brother out of respect.<br>
From a place where old ladies would water jasmine trees at dawn.<br>
From the neighbours’ coffee in the morning<br>
From: after you, aunt; as you wish, uncle; with pleasure, sister…<br>
From a place which endured, which waited, which is still waiting for relief.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Syria.<br>
I will not write poetry for anyone else.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Can anyone teach me<br>
how to make a homeland?<br>
Heartfelt thanks if you can,<br>
heartiest thanks,<br>
from the house-sparrows,<br>
the apple-trees of Syria,<br>
and yours very sincerely.</p>
